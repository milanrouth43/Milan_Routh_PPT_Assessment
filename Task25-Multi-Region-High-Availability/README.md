# Task 1: Multi-Region Highly Available Web Application (AWS)

## Objective
To deploy a fault-tolerant web application across multiple Availability Zones using VPC, ALB, Auto Scaling, EC2, S3, and CloudWatch.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Networking Foundation (VPC)
- Created a custom VPC with a CIDR block of `10.0.0.0/16`.
- Provisioned Public and Private subnets across two Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability.
- Configured an Internet Gateway (IGW) for public access and a NAT Gateway to allow private instances to access the internet securely.

### 2. Compute and Automation (EC2 & ASG)
- Launched two Ubuntu EC2 instances within the private subnets.
- Utilized a User Data script to automate the installation and configuration of the Apache web server upon launch.
- Configured an Auto Scaling Group (ASG) to maintain instance counts and ensure system resilience.

### 3. Traffic Management (ALB)
- Deployed an Application Load Balancer (ALB) in the public subnets to distribute incoming traffic.
- Configured Security Groups using the principle of least privilege, ensuring EC2 instances only accept traffic originating from the ALB.

### 4. Storage and Monitoring
- Created an Amazon S3 bucket for centralized asset storage.
- Configured a CloudWatch Alarm to monitor CPU Utilization, set to trigger an alert if usage exceeds a 70% threshold.

## Resources Configured
- **VPC**: 10.0.0.0/16
- **Instances**: WebServer-1, WebServer-2
- **Load Balancer**: My-Public-ALB (Application Tier)
- **Monitoring**: CPU Utilization Threshold > 70%
- **Tools**: VPC, EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, S3, CloudWatch
